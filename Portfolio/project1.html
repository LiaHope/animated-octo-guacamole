		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		<p> The goal of this project was to redesign the Mattimation site in order to attract clients and appeal to current fans. Mattimation is a 2d animation studio that creates shows featuring female leads, magic, and mermaids. The studio is preparing to branch out to create commercial work for clients and therefore needs a site that conveys that. The previous site was busy and inconsistent in style. When planning the new site I thought about conveying the brand and simplifying the layout.</p>

			<h2> Solutions</h2>
			<p>To better convey the brand, I created a consistent color palette paired with fun but elegant typefaces. I simplified the navigation in order to help users find information quickly and created a clear call to action for potential clients.</p>

			<h2>Wireframes and Layout</h2>
			<p>In the layout I kept the sections straightforward and uncluttered so the content can speak for itself. I added a short opening section after the landing image to explain the work and process of Mattimation. The "Meet the Team" section adds a human element and credibility.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Near the beginning I was largely keeping the original pages the same and just changing their location and accessability. Along the way I received feedback that the site was looking too much like the personal portfolio of one individual without a clear goal. Taking this into consideration, I developed the website to portray Mattimation as a company and focused on 2 goals; finding clients and providing information for existing fans.</p>

			<h4>Live Site Coming Soon!</a></h4>
			<p>In the future I will be able to validate my choices by tracking site traffic and learning if clients are coming to Mattimation with projects.</p>
